    <p class="lead">
    <strong> I love using Data Science and AI to solve complex business problems.</strong> My passion is Cyber Security and I am bringing the best of deep learning and machine learning into the exciting field of Cyber Security Analysis.  
    When I am not data sciencing or hunting cyber threats with algorithms, I enjoy hiking, yoga, rowing, and sci-fi. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is applying data science to cyber security issues like malware detection and network analysis. 
    I create value for companies by protecting valuable assets, reducing financial
    cost of security problems, and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. 
    I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
