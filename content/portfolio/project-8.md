title: Vulnerability Management with OpenVAS
---


#### Project Details

In this project, a secure Azure network was created and populated with two virtual machines, set to run OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner and Windows 10. The Windows 10 virtual machine was made vulnerable by disabling security controls and installing outdated software.

To highlight the significance of properly configuring vulnerability scans, two types of scans were conducted. First, an unauthenticated scan was performed on the Windows 10 machine. Following the completion of the unauthenticated scan, a credentialed scan was configured and initiated. Based on the results of the credentialed scan, remediations were implemented to mitigate major vulnerabilities.

A final credentialed scan was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the implemented remediations.
