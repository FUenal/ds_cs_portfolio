#### Project Details

This application is based on an Artificial Neural Network model to classify policy texts using data from various sources such as news-articles and official government databases. Having an automated text classification model saves a significant amount of time and resources and allows for a real-time tracking of fossil-fuel policy developments.

#### Project Requirements

✅ Jupyter Notebook

✅ Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Keras, SQLite

✅ Artificial Neural Network
