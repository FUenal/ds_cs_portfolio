title: Azure Honeynet - Simulating Real-World Cyber Attacks
---


#### Project Details

The primary goal of this project involved establishing intentionally vulnerable virtual machines within the Azure infrastructure, as detailed [here](https://github.com/FUenal/Azure-VM-Prep/blob/main/README.md). The aim was to attract and analyze cyber attacks, providing valuable insights into the tactics and techniques employed by attackers. Through this initiative, I demonstrated my capability to promptly and efficiently respond to identified issues.
